# Meal Maker

A restaurant has hired you to create a function for their website that allows them to set a meal and price each morning for Today’s Special. Use your knowledge of getters and setters to make sure anyone who uses the new function can generate a meal and a price for Today’s Special without any embarrassing errors!

# Tasks

**1.** We’ll hold the meal, price, and their respective getters and setters in an object named menu.

create an empty menu object.

**2.** The menu object will hold the meal and price of Today’s Special as properties and they shouldn’t be altered directly.

Within the menu object, create a _meal property with a value of an empty string (''). This will eventually hold the name of the meal.
